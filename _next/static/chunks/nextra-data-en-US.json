Additional strategies may be introduced through governance approval. Below are the primary boosting strategies:","default-strategy#Default Strategy":"$PAW stakers can delegate their staking power to one or more validators of their choice. The allocation of BGT to each validator is proportional to the $PAW staked with them. Rewards for stakers are closely tied to the performance of the validators they select, encouraging careful and informed decisions that promote validator accountability.","boosting-auction#Boosting auction":"A portion of the BGT boosting power is auctioned to the highest bidder. This strategy is particularly attractive for:\nValidators seeking to enhance their profits.\nProtocols aiming to increase emissions to their pools, making them more competitive in the ecosystem.\nThis auction mechanism ensures that boosting power is allocated to those who value it most, while generating additional revenue for the protocol.","autoboosting-lbgt-pools#Autoboosting LBGT pools":"Validators who allocate at least 10% (value determined by governance) of their Berachefs to LBGT liquidity pools receive an automatic boost. This strategy deepens *$LBGT liquidity across the ecosystem, enhancing its utility in DeFi applications.By incentivizing $LBGT pools is expected that tokens will shift from stLBGT, increasing the overall $LBGT yield.","voting-strategies#Voting Strategies":"When voting on chain proposals, $PAW stakers are given three options:\nYes\nNo\nAbstain\nIf \"Abstain\" wins, the voting power is automatically sold to the highest bidder.

This ensures that $LBGT continues to earn all block and incentives rewards generated by the underlying BGT.\nRewards: Users have to stake $LBGT to receive incentives rewards. Rewards are reinvested and auto-compounded and since not all $LBGT will be staked, users can expect to receive a multiplier on their earnings.\nTokenization: DeFi vaults can utilize $LBGT to pass along rewards to their users in a streamlined and efficient way.

However, when a validator controls its own BGT, it creates a conflict of interest and potential centralization issues. Validators with control over BGT may prioritize shifting profits toward themselves, engaging in off-chain deals, or manipulating incentives instead of distributing fair rewards to the holders of their BGT wrappers.This centralization also affects chain governance. Validators with concentrated control over BGT can disproportionately influence on-chain decision-making, weakening the decentralized principles of Berachain. Over time, this could lead to skewed governance decisions that benefit a select few rather than the broader ecosystem.BeraPaw takes a fundamentally different approach. By not operating its own validator, BeraPaw instead optimizes BGT delegations across all validators in a decentralized, transparent manner. By also distributing chain voting power to the community we maintain a fair competition among validators and protocols, ensure that rewards are maximized for users, and safeguards the chain's decentralization and security."}}}
